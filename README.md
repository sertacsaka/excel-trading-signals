## Semi-auto algorithmic trading project using power query in excel

It is not a problem to decide whether an instrument is in a buy/sell state by looking at its chart with the help of the indicator, and it does not take much time.
The problem arises when there are too many instruments to choose from, which would be the most suitable for purchase?
For example, there are more than 300 parities on the Binance exchange only on the basis of USDT.
It is not human work to look at all of them on a graph and analyze them before their graph changes.
Although it did not change my economic situation, while searching for a solution to this problem, I discovered that a monster called Power Query lives in the land of Excel.
With its help, you can get into algorithmic trading, albeit semi-automatically, below I have shared my solution as a video.
